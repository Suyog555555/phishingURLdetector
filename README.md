🎯 Usage Examples
Web Interface
Enter a URL in the input field
Click "Check URL" or press Ctrl+Enter
View results with confidence score and risk level
Click "Show Technical Details" for feature analysis
Sample URLs for Testing:
Legitimate: https://www.google.com
Phishing: http://paypal-security.tk/login
Suspicious: http://bit.ly/suspicious-link

🔍 How It Works
URL Input: User enters a URL to analyze
Feature Extraction: System extracts 25+ features from the URL
ML Prediction: Random Forest model classifies the URL
Risk Assessment: Confidence score determines risk level
Result Display: User sees prediction with detailed analysis
---
📊 Model Training
The model is trained on a dataset of phishing and legitimate URLs with features including:

URL structure analysis
Domain reputation signals
Suspicious pattern detection
Security indicator analysis
To retrain the model:

bash
python train_model.py
